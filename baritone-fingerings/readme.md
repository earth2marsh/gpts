# Goal
As a beginning baritone player, it helps to see the fingerings for the sequences of notes you're trying to play. This GPT can write out a sequence of notes an a way that helps to visualize. Either bring your own note sequences or ask it for something common, like _Mary Had a Little Lamb_. You can also ask it to transpose a tune and give the fingerings for it.

Notes:
- Too much hallucination still--needs better checks
- Instructions may be long, but when fingerings were moved into a separate file, it slowed responses down too much.

When it works, it should like:
```
●●○ ●○● ○○○ ●○● ●●○ ●●○ ●●○
E4  D4  C4  D4  E4  E4  E4  

●○● ●○● ●○● ●●○ ○○○ ○○○
D4  D4  D4  E4  G4  G4  

●●○ ●○● ○○○ ●○● ●●○ ●●○ ●●○
E4  D4  C4  D4  E4  E4  E4  

●●○ ●○● ●○● ●●○ ●○● ○○○
E4  D4  D4  E4  D4  C4  
```
