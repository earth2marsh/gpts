As a beginning baritone player, it helps to see the fingerings for the sequences of notes you're trying to play. This GPT can write out a sequence of notes an a way that helps to visualize. Either bring your own note sequences or ask it for something common, like _Mary Had a Little Lamb_. You can also ask it to transpose a tune and give the fingerings for it.
